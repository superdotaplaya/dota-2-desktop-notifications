Games Notifier Help and Documentation (WINDOWS 10 ONLY!!!)

Hello! 

Thank you for installing this app! This is my first application and would appreciate any and all feedback you may have! Feel free to shoot me an email at superdotaplaya@gmail.com with any questions, issues, ideas, or concerns!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setup!

1.) Open the "add_games.exe" file, this will prompt you to enter the AppID of the game or games you would like t get news for, enter it there. (to get this id number, go to the steam stor page for the game and take the number at the end of the link!) Enter only one app id at a time, once you submit one it will ask you for another app, if you have one enter it then, if not just close the app!

2.) Open the "news_notifications.exe" file and you should be all set, setup is very simple!

3.) Check the settings information below this section to understand your options to change your own experience!

SETTINGS!

1.) This app checks for new news every 60 seconds by default, if you are on a metered connection it is recommended you increase this (it doesnt use a lot of data in general but just a warning :) )
	To change this open the "settings" file and find the "refresh" option and input your desired time (in seconds). Then restart the app!

2.) If you would like to get a notification for each app when you boot up your pc for the latest news change the "ShowAll" option in settings to true, this is false by default so it does not spam users!

Adding this app to your startup apps!

1.) Create a shortcut by right clicking the "news_notifications.exe" file and then click create shortcut

2.) Copy (ctrl + c) or cut (ctrl + x) the shortcut file and navigate to your startup apps folder found here "C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup" replace username with the name of your user on the PC you are using!

3.) past ethe shortcut into this folder! (ctrl + v) and then close the window! Now each time you styart up your computer the app will run in the background and you will no longer miss the latest news! 

IF THE APP REFUSES TO LAUNCH PLEASE DELETE EVERYTHING BETWEEN THE BRACKETS IN THE APP_LIST FILE!!!! THEN ENTER YOUR APP ID'S AGAIN!



That should be about it! Have fun and say informed on the latest for your steam games!
